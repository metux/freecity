* rubble
    * check on build --> auto bulldoze ?
* rails
    * sprites
* create road w/ check and payment
* clean tiles
* lakes
* trees
    * sprites & render
* tests
    * place random rubble
    * place random trees
* buildings
    * individual names
    * demolish
* plant trees
* budgets
* industries + demands + taxes
* bonds
* ordinances
* water/pipes
* highways
* tunnels
* coast
* powerlines consume power
* pollution
* weather
* building only when 3 tiles away from road or rail
    -> best density: 6x6 surrounded by road/rail
* roads:
    44 cars per minute --> no/low traffic
    88 --> light traffic
* climate trends
* clouds, rain
* lakes
* move errect* w/ payments to Game ?

* render-cairo:
    * optimize rendering
    * current prescale (0.5) is good for lower scaling levels, but looks ugly above 1.0
    * maybe switch prescale based on scale (re-render basemap, etc)
    * maybe selective re-rendering based on viewport
    * maybe add extra clipping to final target surface ?

* UI GTK
    * menu bar
    * retrieve available building list
    * Wall clock
    * prescale vs pointer-2-tile
